# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Embedded Machine Learning using TinyML
Using Deep Learning implemented a model on Raspberry Pi that will detect the chances of probable heart failure
Python, Machine Learning, Tensorflow Lite, Raspberry Pi
Prediction of chances of Heart Failure using Artificial Neural Networks in Keras and Tensorflow
It included the conversion of the model to Tensorflow Lite and finally deploymrnt of the model on Raspberry Pi using Interpreter class
Allows real time heart failure prediction by running sophisticated Deep Learning Models on edge devices like Mobiles or Smart watches
